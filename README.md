# intelligent-loading-shimmer
Generate nice loading shimmers for ANY (every!) page in your nextjs app using AI with one command.

Loading screens appear instantly to make your site feel faster, give the users the confidence to stick around, and buy developers time to fetch whatever data.

`intelligent-loading-shimmer` automatically generates a `loading.tsx` to go along with each server component's `page.tsx` **that uses AI to match the general layout of the page**.

`intelligent-loading-shimmer` makes your site feel faster to users while letting you stay focused on building your actual product:
- Automatically stays up-to-date when you make changes to your pages
- Mimics the layout of your pages, including locally imported components
- Components live in your repo, can be customized freely, and work with your version control
- Works with or without tailwind

## How to use
```bash
npx intelligent-loading-shimmer
# âœ… generated loading pages for 3 files
```
or add it to your project:
```bash
npm i --save-dev intelligent-loading-shimmer
```
In package.json:
```js
//package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    // add it to your prebuild to automatically keep up with changes
    "prebuild": "intelligent-loading-shimmer",
    // or just make a custom command for it that matches your preferences
    "generate-loading": "intelligent-loading-shimmer",
  },
}
```
That's it! You need an env variable for `OPENAI_API_KEY`. By defualt, looks in `.env` in your project.

Command-line options:
- `-e, --env <path>`: Path to an env file with an `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key` defined
- `-f, --force`: Force an overwrite of existing loading files
